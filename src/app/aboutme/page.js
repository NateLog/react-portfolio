      <p>
        For the past 12 years, I’ve been immersed in a journey that has taken me
        to the farthest corners of the globe, from the raw reality of refugee
        camps to the serene luxury of world-class beaches. My passion for
        exploration has fueled countless adventures and broadened my
        understanding of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, I’m ready to channel that same enthusiasm and curiosity into a new
        chapter, returning to my nerdy Physicist roots as I dive into a career
        in web development. It’s time to build and create, using my
        resourcefulness and sometimes overshared story telling to create
        innovative solutions to the world's newest problems.
